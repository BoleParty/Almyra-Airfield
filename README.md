You got two options to add this area to your server:

1.

Pack the folder "a3_epoch_custom" into a .pbo file and throw in your @epochhive\addons.

PLEASE NOTE:

I wasn`t able to test the .pbo as the file was crashing my arma every time i tried to join my testserver so i can`t guarentee that the objects will spawn if you are using option 1. The server was running fine tho and the .rpt log file showed a running pbo.

I can`t seem to say what is causing the crashes unfortunately. Hopefully it`s just on my machine so just try out if it`s working for you.

If you encounter the same then you still have option 2.


2.

Unpack your a3_epoch_server_settings.pbo(being located in @epochhive\addons) and replace your "altis.h" (being located in a3_epoch_server_settings\configs\maps) with mine.

If you already have an edited altis.h file then just add the content of "almyra.txt" to it.

Make it a .pbo again and throw back into @epochhive\addons.
